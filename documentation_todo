- Rationalise the documentation generation process. Figure out why it's so complicated.
- Write documentation recommendations and guide.
- Get the headers added correctly.
- Get markdown working correctly.
- Add unit tests to allow for renaming the Arch classes.
- Rename and alias Arch classes to remove underscore.

Alternative documentation 

Ideal:

- Auto generates on changes.
- Easy to see where it's been generated and to see changes.
- Easy to install on all systems.
- Elegant handling of both c++ and python.
- Does not make docstrings worse.
- Low barrier to entry to make it easier for developers to document changes.

Design:

- Use sphinx.
- Use docstrings in google style. 
  - http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/usage/extensions/example_google.html#example-google
  - https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings
- Use autodoc with napoleon to extract these docstrings.
- Have sphinx documentation as higher level documentation. Things that don't make sense to include in a docstring.

- Use several entr sessions to autogenerate on changes, with different actions for c++ changes, python changes, and
  sphinx changes. These entr changes should assume that only comments and documentation will change.
- Each major section of cpp based FreeCAD will have it's own breathe project and doxygen session. This will speed up
  build times by only processing the parts that have changed.

Todo:

- Done! Setup sphinx
- Done! Setup autodoc, and get it working with FreeCAD
- Done! Setup a simple autobuild on change process.
- Done! Setup breath/doxygen and get it working with documents.
- Split the breath and doxygen build processes into many different breathe
  projects to speed up build times.
- Setup a autobuild process for all the existing processes.
- Setup napoleon and get it working with documents.
- Document the installation process for a prospective documentor.
- Work out a basic, readable document structure.
- Make a suitable theme.

Negatives:

- Have to build FreeCAD each time you make a change to python, because sphinx
  is pulling the python docstrings and module structure from the build FreeCAD.
  This is due to the cython not being readable as python until it is built.
- Probably only works on linux and mac.
